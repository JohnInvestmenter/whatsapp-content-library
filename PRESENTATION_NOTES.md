## Objection Handling

### "We already have [tool]"
**Response:** "That's great! Content Library complements your existing tools by centralizing everything in one place. Think of it as your team's single source of truth."

### "Seems complicated to set up"
**Response:** "I understand. That's why we do most of the setup for you. 15 minutes of your time, and we handle the rest."

### "Our team won't use it"
**Response:** "That's a valid concern. That's why we start with a pilot program - prove the value to a small group first. We've seen 95% adoption within 2 weeks."

### "Too expensive"
**Response:** "Let's break down the math. You're currently losing $3,900/month in productivity. Content Library costs $15/month. That's a 260x return."

### "We need IT approval"
**Response:** "Perfect! We have a technical spec sheet for your IT team. It uses tools you already have - Notion, Google Drive, WhatsApp."

### "What if we want to cancel?"
**Response:** "No long-term contract. Month-to-month. Keep using the free tier if you want. Your content stays in your Notion - you own it."
