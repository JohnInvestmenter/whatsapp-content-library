## Thread Replies (Prepared Responses)

**Q: Is training required?**
A: Nope! There's an interactive tutorial built-in. Just click the 🎓 Tutorial button and it walks you through everything. Takes about 5 minutes.

**Q: Can I use this on mobile?**
A: Yes! It's fully responsive and works great on mobile browsers.

**Q: What if I want to add my own categories?**
A: The categories are defined in the Notion database. You can customize them there and they'll sync to the platform.

**Q: How secure is it?**
A: All content is stored in our Notion workspace with team-based access control. Files are stored in Google Drive. Everything uses enterprise-grade security.

**Q: Can I edit content after creating it?**
A: Absolutely! Every content item has an Edit button. Make changes anytime.

**Q: What's the difference between WhatsApp and Email copy?**
A: WhatsApp copy preserves markdown formatting (*bold*, _italic_). Email copy automatically converts to HTML so formatting appears correctly in email clients like Gmail/Outlook.

**Q: Do I need to install anything?**
A: No installation needed! It's a web-based platform. Just open it in your browser.

**Q: Can I see who's using what content?**
A: The platform tracks usage counts and last used dates. We can add more detailed analytics in the future if needed.
